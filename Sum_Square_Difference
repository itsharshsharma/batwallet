The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
12 + 22 + ... + 102 = 385

The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
(1 + 2 + ... + 10)2 = 552 = 3025

Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.

Solution:
#defining function for 1st and second series
def sumsn(x):
    sum=0
    for i in range(1,x):
        sum+=i**2
    return sum
def ssumn(a):
    b=0
    for v in range(1,a):
        b+=v
    return b**2
    
#assigning result to variables
sum_of_square = sumsn(101)
square_of_sum = ssumn(101)

#printing the final result
print(square_of_sum-sum_of_square)
ans. 25164150
